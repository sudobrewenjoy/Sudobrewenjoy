## Hi there 👋

<!--
**👋 Hi, I’m consensysstar
I’m a Senior Fullstack Engineer with a love for building real-time, interactive web apps and multiplayer games. Over the past few years I’ve worked across startups and ambitious projects, turning complex ideas into fast, scalable products. I lean frontend but enjoy owning the full stack—from elegant UIs to resilient backend systems.

🕹️ What I Do
Craft beautiful, responsive interfaces with React, Next.js, and TypeScript
Build real-time experiences using WebSockets, event-driven backends, and distributed systems
Bring apps to life with animations (Framer Motion, GSAP, Rive) that feel smooth and natural
Work with Node.js, Kafka, and Mongo/Postgres to power data-heavy, high-traffic services
Experiment with blockchain tech (Solana, Ethereum) to create on-chain games and dApps
🔧 Tech I Use (and love)
React · Next.js · Node.js · TypeScript · Kafka · MongoDB · PostgreSQL · Rive · GSAP · WebSockets · Solana · Ethereum · Docker · Kubernetes · GraphQL · TailwindCSS

🌱 A Little About Me
I enjoy working on products where speed meets creativity—games, interactive platforms, anything that challenges what the web can do. I thrive in small, collaborative teams, where design and engineering come together to ship great things. Outside of code, you’ll probably find me testing new games, contributing to open-source, or chasing down a perfect flat white. ☕

⚡ Fun Fact
I once stayed up all night debugging a multiplayer game only to realize… it was a single missing semicolon. (Still worth it. Players logged in the next morning without a hitch.)

Always learning. Always shipping.
